# 📝 PromptCraft

PromptCraft is a lightweight, web-based tool for building structured, reusable prompts for ChatGPT and other LLMs. Instead of writing raw prompts over and over again, PromptCraft helps you organize sections like system messages, instructions, variables, and few-shot examples — with live preview and export features.

> 💡 Designed for prompt engineers, developers, and LLM users who want to streamline their workflow.
